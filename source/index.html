    <h1>What's a bd808â€½</h1>
    <p>Sometime in 1994 I was made technial contact on the domain registration
    for <a href="http://www.collegeofidaho.edu/">my university</a>. This meant
    that I was assigned my first <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIC_handle">NIC handle</a>. I was
    apparently the 808<sup>th</sup> person with the initials "B" &amp; "D" to
    register. I've used a lot of other random and/or semi-autobiographical
    handles and usernames on the web, but eventaully I realized that "bd808"
    almost always available and the others were almost always taken.</p>
