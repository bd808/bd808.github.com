    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://boxen.github.com/">Boxen</a> is a framework and collection of libraries created by the fine folks
at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> to make setting up and managing Mac OS X computers easy and
repeatable. Rather than a simple set of shell scripts or other provisioning
tools, Boxen uses <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> to automate installing and configuring software.
I don&#39;t have the time or space to explain how great Puppet is a configuration
management is, so you&#39;ll have to trust me or go do your own research.</p>

<p>Anybody could take a stab at rolling their own collection of Puppet manifests
to manage their laptop or their corporate install base. That&#39;s actually
exactly what GitHub did to create Boxen. Having tried (and failed) at doing
just that before I was pretty impressed when I gave Boxen a test drive. GitHub
has not only provided a system that &quot;works for them&quot;; they have also managed
to engineer a reasonably extensible solution for a very complex problem.</p>

<p>You can use your favorite search engine to find folks who can wax poetic about
the magnitude of this accomplishment. Let&#39;s get on with a description of what
I&#39;ve been able to do with it.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I&#39;m using Boxen to manage my <code>$DAYJOB</code> laptop. This was a great place to start
because I had a brand new laptop that needed to be setup and a brand new tool
to use to do it. I started by following the <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen">bootstrapping instructions</a> to
create <a href="https://github.com/bd808/my-boxen">my own copy of the template project</a>. I made a few changes to the
<a href="https://github.com/bd808/my-boxen/blob/master/manifests/site.pp">site manifest</a> and then started working on a <a href="https://github.com/bd808/my-boxen/blob/master/modules/people/manifests/bd808.pp">manifest for myself</a>.</p>

<p>Along the way I decided I didn&#39;t like a few of the decisions that the Boxen
architects had made. As I pointed out earlier, the team behind Boxen
anticipated this and changing most things is as easy as forking a repo, making
your change and updating the <a href="https://github.com/bd808/my-boxen/blob/master/Puppetfile">Puppetfile</a> in your Boxen project.</p>

<p>At the moment I have customized or created these repositories:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bd808/my-boxen">my-boxen</a>: My fork of <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen">boxen/our-boxen</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bd808/puppet-boxen">puppet-boxen</a>: Fork of the core
<a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-boxen">boxen/puppet-boxen</a> modules that
installs <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> in <code>/usr/local</code> instead of under
<code>/opt/boxen</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bd808/puppet-dnsmasq">puppet-dnsmasq</a>: Fork of
<a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-dnsmasq">boxen/dnsmasq</a> that uses the stock
Homebrew <code>dnsmasq</code> install and provides <code>dnsmasq::address</code> to configure new
address mappings.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bd808/puppet-geektool">puppet-geektool</a>: Original
module to install <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/">GeekTool</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bd808/puppet-git">puppet-git</a>: Fork of
<a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-git">boxen/puppet-git</a> to use the stock
Homebrew version of <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bd808/puppet-growl">puppet-growl</a>: Fork of
<a href="https://github.com/petems/puppet-growl">petems/puppet-growl</a> that installs
an aging version of <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>. I&#39;ve since abandoned this
in favor a <a href="http://growl.info/documentation/developer/growl-source-install.php">self-compiled version</a> which I should figure out how to Puppetize.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bd808/puppet-homebrew">puppet-homebrew</a>: Fork of
<a href="https://github.com/nybblr/puppet-homebrew">nybblr/puppet-homebrew</a> that
adds support for installing in <code>/usr/local</code> and using custom Homebrew
<a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/brew-tap">taps</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bd808/puppet-monolingual">puppet-monolingual</a>: Original
module to install <a href="http://monolingual.sourceforge.net/">Monolingual</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bd808/puppet-osx">puppet-osx</a>: Fork of
<a href="https://github.com/codec/puppet-osx">codec/puppet-osx</a> that pulls in
patches from <a href="https://github.com/joebadmo/puppet-osx">joebadmo/puppet-osx</a>
and adds a few system settings of my own.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bd808/puppet-slimbatterymonitor">puppet-slimbatterymonitor</a>: Original module to install <a href="http://www.orange-carb.org/SBM/">SlimBatteryMonitor</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The one thing I most wish someone would figure out how to do with Boxen/Puppet
is install apps from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/apps/app-store.html">Mac App Store</a>.</p>
